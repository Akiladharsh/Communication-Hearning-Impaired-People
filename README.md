# Abstract

The ability to communicate defines us as human beings and as a society .Human senses help us to  provide information about our environment that we can use to live       safely and achieve our goals . Audioception plays a major role in communication with society.   The idea of the project is to create a single device to aid people with   various levels of hearing complexities . We have used Jetson nano as the processing unit which helps us run various AI and python libraries with high efficiency . We     have also used an Arduino UNO board to create a hardware setup for the same.  The user will be aware with the help of audio input  and the signals will be passed to     the vibrators to identify the direction of the audio input . For further communication ,  we also added speech to text libraries which aids them by converting audio     into captions displayed in the  led screen attached . Sign language can also be recognized by our device using a camera which helps the deaf to understand even when     they are not aware of the same . We also have added features such as live captioning , phone call indication and text to speech using various ai modules.
